curlcpp
=======

An object oriented C++ wrapper for cURL tool. I'm working for you :P

There a bunch of cURL C++ wrappers out there, but I personally don't like any of them. So, I was writing a framework for my university and I needed a curl wrap in C++, so I wrote it.
I'm still working on it, so, if you find bugs or errors, please tell me! :)

I will write documentation and examples, so stay in touch!
